## Employee Turnover Predictions

### Abstract

The purpose of this study is to develop an employee turnover prediction model for organizations. Employee turnover is a significant issue for many companies, as it can lead to high recruitment and training costs, reduced productivity, and lower morale among remaining employees. In this study, we will use various machine learning algorithms to analyze data on employee characteristics and workplace factors, in order to identify the factors that contribute to employee turnover. The model will then be used to predict which employees are most likely to leave the company in the near future, allowing organizations to proactively address the problem and minimize its impact. The results of this study will provide valuable insights for HR managers and executives, and will contribute to the development of more effective strategies for reducing employee turnover and improving retention.





### Problem Statement:

The goal is to provide organizations with a tool for analyzing employee characteristics and workplace factors,identifying the factors that contribute to employee turnover, and predicting which employees are most likely to leave. By doing so, organizations will be better equipped to proactively address the problem and minimize its impact.

### Scope:

The scope of the employee turnover prediction model involves the following:

Data collection: The study will utilize data on employee characteristics, such as job role,satisfaction_level,number of project worked and salary.The data will be collected through surveys and other sources, and will be used to train the machine learning algorithms.

Feature selection and preprocessing: The data collected will undergo feature selection and preprocessing to remove any redundant or irrelevant information, and to prepare it for analysis.

Model evaluation: The model will be evaluated using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, to ensure that it is capable of accurately predicting employee turnover.


### Learning Outcome:

The learning outcomes from this project include understanding of machine learning algorithms,knowledge of employee turnover and its impact, predictive modeling skills, data analysis and interpretation, and problem-solving and decision-making skills. Participants will gain hands-on experience in developing a predictive model and will be equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to tackle similar problems in their future careers.
